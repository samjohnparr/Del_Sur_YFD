### Purpose and Objectives of M & E


M&E in schools aims to **provide objective information** that can **inform decision-making** in order to continuously improve the delivery of school services for basic education and the school’s performance or health to achieve the desired education outcomes. M&E in schools aims to provide valid, reliable and accurate data in decision-making to come up with possible actions and interventions to achieve the desired education outcomes.

</center>

Five specific operational objectives are identified in support of the overall purpose of M&E in the school:

**OBJECTIVES**

  1. Provide the school management and stakeholders information on the implementation of the **curricular programs and projects as** basis for continuously improving their relevance, efficiency and effectiveness  
  2. Provide information for school management to determine and adjust approaches and strategies that will ensure adequacy, equitable distribution, accessibility, and effective and optimal use of the **resources** of the school
  3. Establish information as basis for determining appropriate approach / strategy to improve **teaching-learning competencies of teachers** to ensure efficient and effective delivery of instruction, classroom management, and their personal growth and professional development  
  4. Present information regarding **learner performance** to the school management that will support decisions and adjustments to plans and strategies to improve the learners’ academic achievement, school attendance, and participation in co-curricular activities.
  5. Provide information for school management to review and sustain the strategies that can improve the **school’s health or performance** through:
  
      * Efficient school-based management
      * Productivity of the teaching and non-teaching staff
      * Strengthening partnership with the community
      
**Underlying Principles**

The development of the Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for the school is to be guided by the following principles:

  a. **Quality Information**

It is important that M&E information to be collected is appropriate, sufficient and accurate to ensure reliable and objective reports that can be used as bases for planning and decision-making at all levels. 
  
  b. **Systems Strengthening**

Strategies, processes, and tools to be used for M&E can make use of available systems that have been tried and effectively used in the department.  .  (available and established mechanism)

  c. **Efficiency**
  
Results are achieved with minimum input resources but not compromising quality in all levels and stages of M&E. This includes the ability to report on target sub-groups in a timely manner. (Efficiency in general describes the extent to which time or effort is well used for the intended task or purpose in the production of desired goals and outputs.)

  d. **Transparency of Information to Key Stakeholders**
  
M&E subscribes to open, full and credible information. It encourages timely disclosure of information and methodology to stakeholders which are aligned to M&E objectives and processes.

  e. **Synergy**
  
M&E encourages participative and collaborative decision-making processes among the different entities for an integrated approach to the attainment of its objectives.

  f. **M&E for Learning and Accountability**
  
M&E provides opportunities for continuous improvement of practices/performance through identification of issues and lessons learned.  It requires trustworthy, competent and impartial M&E staff.

  g. **Focus**

M&E calls for careful planning and purposive prioritization of activities guided by the school goals and objectives.  “Change does not happen by accident.” The school is a key instrument to implement that change.


### SCOPE OF M&E

**M&E Content Areas**

There are two major focal areas where decisions need to be made:  *Delivery of Services for Basic Education and Organizational Health/Performance.*
